- Enter kilometers driven by the car.
- Get instant price prediction.
- Clean and responsive user interface with Bootstrap and custom dark theme CSS.

- Python 3
- Flask (Web framework)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression model)
- Bootstrap 5 (Frontend styling)
- JavaScript (dynamic frontend behavior)
- Jinja2 (templating engine)
